# SpeechArrestData

The purpose of this project is to investigated speech arrest, a phenemenon that occurs during cortical stimulation in which a patient undergoing music or language mapping is unable to complete an utterance or a string of utterances in language, and notes or a sequence of notes in music. The code here compiles data from 34 patients which have been annotated and categorized based on the type of "arrest" exhibited from intraoperative coritcal stimulation of patients undergoing typical language mapping for tumor resection. Additionally, this python code inputs the data from a csv file and calculates the latency information of the arrest and corresponds the anatomical regions of where speech arrest occured. 

The MATLAB code presents a visualization of latency information across all patients for the 4 different types of speech arrest over time.
